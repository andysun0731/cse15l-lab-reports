## Part 1:
* Changing the name of the `start` parameter and its uses to `base`
* `/start<Enter>dwibase<Esc>ndwibase<Esc>ndwibase<Esc>ndwibase<Esc>:wq`
1. `/start<Enter>`: I type this command to find words that matches the pattern "start"

## Part 2:
* I took 53 seconds to use the first method and 65 seconds to use the second method. I have difficulties memory all the commands in Vim.
1. I think I will choose the second style because after I am familiar with Vim, I no longer need to go to the local computer to edit things. I can do it totally on remote which can save me a lot of time.
2. Maybe the factor will be I am not that familiar with Vim commands, sometimes it spends me a lot of time searching for commands when using Vim.
